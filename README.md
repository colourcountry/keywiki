# keywiki

A stand-alone mini-wiki in an HTML5 page with no links!
Instead, a hot key performs an instant search on the current word, or phrase if within square brackets.
Because the search pulls up all other mentions of the word as well as any pages with that name, it acts as both a link and an instant back link.

No other explicit markup, plain text only, although you can type in markdown or similar if you like.

Requires IndexedDB I should imagine, I haven't written it yet.
